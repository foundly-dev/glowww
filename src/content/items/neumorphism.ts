  description:
    "Neumorphism, also known as soft UI, is a visual design trend that combines elements of skeuomorphism and flat design. It creates a soft, extruded plastic look by using subtle contrasting shadows to create the illusion of depth. This style mimics physical objects while maintaining a minimal and modern aesthetic, often featuring monochromatic color schemes with low contrast shadows and highlights.",
